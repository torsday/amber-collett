– Research Interests
Physical, environmental and cultural shaping of urban communities: Urban land use policy, social determinants of health, urban green space development and use, civic engagement, neighborhood identity formation, and sense of place. 

– Current Research
Amber Collett's mixed-methods research broadly explores the intersection between human and ecological health in complex urban environments, with a focus on issues relating to urban green space, health inequities and civic engagement. Currently, she is exploring how urban renewal policies and practices may have shaped community perceptions of health and well-being in Harlem Park, West Baltimore. She is also conducting research on hospital development and use of green roofs. Ms. Collett is also interested in therapeutic landscapes and evaluating their mitigating effects on social determinants of health, with a specific focus on healing gardens and horticultural therapy.
